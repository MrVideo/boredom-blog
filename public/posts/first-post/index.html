Since this is my first post here, I should introduce myself.
Hi, I&rsquo;m Mario, I&rsquo;m a Computer Engineering student and I&rsquo;m starting this blog out of boredom.
I&rsquo;ve wanted to start a blog for a while now and I think it might be a good way to track my progress in learning things.
This blog won&rsquo;t have a specific topic, as I am interested in way to many things to be specific about just one.">

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Since this is my first post here, I should introduce myself.</p>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Mario, I&rsquo;m a Computer Engineering student and I&rsquo;m starting this blog out of boredom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to start a blog for a while now and I think it might be a good way to track my progress in learning things.</p>
<p>This blog won&rsquo;t have a specific topic, as I am interested in way to many things to be specific about just one. I hope you&rsquo;ll find the things I&rsquo;ll write about interesting!</p>
<p>So, talking about me, I am a drummer, I love listening to music and I like to tinker with stuff on my computer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to spend more time offline right now, so I won&rsquo;t be putting my social media links on this blog. I&rsquo;d rather show my GitHub page and add an email instead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing this at 1 AM while listening to <em>Letter from Home</em> by the Pat Metheny Group (more specifically, <em>Lyle Mays</em>), so I think it&rsquo;s time to call it a day, I have no more stuff to write about right now.</p>
<p>I hope to see you around :)</p>
