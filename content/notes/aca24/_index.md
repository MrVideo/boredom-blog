These notes are from the *Advanced Computer Architectures* course I attended in 2024. I mainly wrote them while studying from the book "*Computer Architecture - A quantitative approach*" by John Hennessy and David Patterson.

> **Note**: these notes do not contain the last part of the course (namely multiprocessors, thread-level parallelism and cache coherence protocols) because the book described them in a far too detailed way compared to what was seen in the course. Thus, I recommend viewing the slides for those topics [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/vx130qqkmk6idnx1mmcw9/h/Lectures?dl=0&subfolder_nav_tracking=1).
