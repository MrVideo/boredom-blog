These notes are from the *Advanced Computer Architectures* course I attended in 2024. I mainly wrote them while studying from the book "*Computer Architecture - A quantitative approach*" by John Hennessy and David Patterson.

## Slide additions

Some information was left out of the main pages because it was not in the book I studied from. If you're looking for that information, you can find it [here](aca24-slide-additions).

## Cheat sheet

The main formulas used in this course can be found in this [cheat sheet](cheat-sheet.pdf).
