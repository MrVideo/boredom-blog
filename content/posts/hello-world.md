Hi there!

Since this is my first post here, I should introduce myself.

Hi, I'm Mario, I'm a Computer Engineering student and I'm starting this blog out of boredom.

I've wanted to start a blog for a while now and I think it might be a good way to track my progress in learning things.

This blog won't have a specific topic, as I am interested in way to many things to be specific about just one. I hope you'll find the things I'll write about interesting!

So, talking about me, I am a drummer, I love listening to music and I like to tinker with stuff on my computer.

I'm trying to spend more time offline right now, so I won't be putting my social media links on this blog. I'd rather show my GitHub page and add an email instead.

I'm writing this at 1 AM while listening to *Letter from Home* by the Pat Metheny Group (more specifically, *Lyle Mays*), so I think it's time to call it a day, I have no more stuff to write about right now.

I hope to see you around :)
