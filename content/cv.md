## Education

- **Currently**: MSc Computer Science and Engineering @ Politecnico di Milano
- **2020 - 2023**: BSc Ingegneria Informatica @ Politecnico di Milano

## Projects

- **My shelfie**: A complex Java table-top game built with a team of four people. It included online multiplayer with a client-
server paradigm, supported by two technologies: sockets and Java RMI. The software system is based on
the MVC design pattern, while many parts follow an Observer pattern for data communication among
server-side components.
- **Pier-zon**: A Java EE-based web application for an imaginary e-commerce platform. The server backend was created
with Java Enterprise Edition, Java Beans and Thymeleaf, while the frontend web page was created through
plain HTML 5 and CSS 3. The web app relied on a MySQL database to store data and the user session to
store temporary information about the client.
- **PoliResourceBot.js**: A Discord bot built upon the JavaScript discord.js library that lets users search among studying resources.
The bot is built with Node.js and it relies on a MySQL database to handle both querying and insertion of
data.
- **PortableGPT.js**: A Discord bot that relies on the OpenAI ChatGPT API to send requests to GPT-3 and receive its responses.
- **aziendaagricolasuccigiacomo.com**: A responsive website built with HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript to power a dynamic slideshow. The
website adapts its layout to both desktop and mobile.
